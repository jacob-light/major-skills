We can use course descriptions to dig deeper into how course content differs across fields or over time. Using NLP methods, I extract the words most distinctive among courses offered in a given academic year or among courses in a common department group during the 2020-2021 school year. Studying changes across time reveals some expected changes in course content over time (for example, the 2020-21 school year highlights words associated with virtual learning, such as COVID, Zoom, and synchronous), but also highlights a growing emphasis on courses that instruct in Python or engage with the Intersectionality of identity.
